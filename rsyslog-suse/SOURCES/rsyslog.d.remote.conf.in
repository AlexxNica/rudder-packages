## Note, that when you enable any of the MYSQL, PGSQL or GSSAPI
## features, you can't use a remote /usr file system any more!!

# Remote Logging (we use TCP for reliable delivery)
# An on-disk queue is created for this action. If the remote host is
# down, messages are spooled to disk and sent when it is up again.

#$ActionQueueFileName uniqName # unique name prefix for spool files
#$ActionQueueMaxDiskSpace 1g   # 1gb space limit (use as much as possible)
#$ActionQueueSaveOnShutdown on # save messages to disk on shutdown
#$ActionQueueType LinkedList   # run asynchronously
#$ActionResumeRetryCount -1    # infinite retries if host is down
# remote host is: name/ip:port, e.g. 192.168.0.1:514, port optional

# ######### Receiving Messages from Remote Hosts ########## 
# TCP Syslog Server:
# provides TCP syslog reception and GSS-API (if compiled to support it)
#$ModLoad imtcp.so  # load module
# Note: as of now, you need to use the -t command line option to
# enable TCP reception (e.g. -t514 to run a server at port 514/tcp)
# This will change in later v3 releases.

# UDP Syslog Server:
#$ModLoad imudp.so  # provides UDP syslog reception
#$UDPServerRun 514 # start a UDP syslog server at standard port 514
